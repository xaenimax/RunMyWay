# RunMyWay
Capstone Project for Android NanoDegree Developer course

Notes:
The rubric regarding the AsyncTask is implemented in the NewsActivity, it is accessible through the Toolbar in the MainActivity.
You will need the NYT Api key, you can get it here <a href='https://developer.nytimes.com/signup'>NYT Developer site</a> and insert it in the gradle.properties file in this way:
NYT_API_KEY = "your_api_key"

Tha app implements a Google Sign in in the MainActivity, you can look <a href='https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/start-integrating'>here</a> to configure the project to OAuth2.

I have also implemented Google Location services in the RunSessionActivity, the Google Fit service is implemented in both MainActivity and RunSessionActivity.
